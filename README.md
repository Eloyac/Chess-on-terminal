This is a simple chess game implemented in C++. The game runs in the console and allows two players to move pieces on a chessboard.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<h3>Game Rules</h3>

The game is for two players, represented by the white and black pieces.
Each player takes turns to make a move.
During their turn, a player selects a piece to move and then enters the coordinates of its current position and its desired position.
Pieces move according to standard chess rules.
The game continues until a player achieves checkmate on the opponent's king.

<h3>Game Controls</h3>
During each turn, the program will prompt the current player to enter the piece they want to move and the movement coordinates.

<h4>We hope you enjoy playing chess. Good luck!</h4>
